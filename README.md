# Crunchyroll_SimF

### Description

This Firefox extension enhances the user experience on the Crunchyroll release calendar by adding advanced filtering options.

### Features:

✅ Watchlist Filter – Show only entries that are on your Crunchyroll watchlist.

🌐 Language Filter – Hide entries that are not available in your selected language (e.g. German, English, French, etc.).

⚙️ Language Selector – Easily change your preferred language using a dropdown menu. Your selection is saved automatically.

📅 Compatible with Crunchyroll’s current calendar layout – No server interaction or background requests needed.

This extension works entirely locally in your browser and does not collect or transmit any data. It simply improves visibility and usability by hiding irrelevant entries from the calendar view.

### How It Works
When enabled, the extension scans each calendar entry and checks:

If the anime is marked in your Crunchyroll queue.

If the language displayed in the popover (e.g. “(German Dub)”) matches your selected filter.

Entries that don’t meet the active filter criteria are hidden from view.

### Permissions
This extension does not require any special permissions. It only runs on the Crunchyroll calendar page.

### License
MIT License – free to use, modify, and distribute.
